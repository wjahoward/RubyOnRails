Installation and Introduction of Ruby on Rails 

**Note: The installation process below is having an assumption that your laptop runs on Windows 10 as the Operating Software (OS)**

To install Ruby on Rails on Windows 10:
1. Go to http://railsinstaller.org/en
2. Click `Windows Ruby 2.3`

Once installed successfully, do the following to create a simple web app:
1. Open `Command Prompt with Ruby and Rails`
2. Type `gem install bundler`. You may get a Firewall notification, just click `Allow Access`
3. To verify rails has installed, type `rails -v`
4. Type `rails new test_app` - rails new (name of solution)
5. Type `cd test_app` - change directory to name of solution
6. Type `bundler exec rails server` - runs on rails application
7. Go to the browser by typing the url which is something like the following: *localhost:(your port number) i.e. localhost:3000*
8. Once loaded the URL, the end product should show something like *"Yay! You're on Rails!"*

With that, congrats in finishing installing Ruby on Rails... Now, let's move on in having an introduction of what Ruby and Ruby on Rails are about respectively! :)
